# Introduction
This game is a simple dice game simulating the rolling of two dice. If the user rolls a double, the value of the two dice they rolled doubles,
and they must roll again. If the user rolls a single one, their turn if over and they score 0 for that round. The first to reach 60 points wins the game.

#### ** The game currently only has the player's turn working, and the computer's turn needs to still be implemented. **
